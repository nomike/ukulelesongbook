# regular
This is the regular variant of the songbook.
If you're printing this at home, this is the variant you want to print.

Songs are always in alphabetical
order and printed copies could be updated without reprinting everything.

All songs will always start on the left, to minimize the need of flipping pages
while you are playing. This however requires empty pages to be inserted if a
song spans an odd number of pages.

Also, due to the nature of being updateable, this variant does not have numbered
pages, nor does it show page numbers in the table of contents.

# printshop
The printshop variant has numbered pages and also shows the page numbers in the
table of contents. No empty pages are inserted while still keeping the need of
flipping pages. So this variant is ideal for giving it to a professional
printshop (hence the name).

This requires some sacrifices though:
* incremental updates are not possible
* songs are not always in perfect alphabetic order
