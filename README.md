nomike's Ukulele Songbook
=========================

This repository contains scripts to create nomike's ukulele Songbook.

The songbook comes in an ukulele and a guitar edition. The main difference is
that the guitar edition uses guitar-chord-diagrams for standard tuning (EADGBE)
whereas the ukulele edition uses chord diagrams specific to the ukulele standard
tuning (GCEA).
It is also possible to specify songs or versions of them to appear only in one
of the editions. See the documentation for details.
