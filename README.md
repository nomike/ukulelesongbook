nomike's Ukulele Songbook
=========================

This repository contains scripts to create nomike's ukulele Songbook.

The song book comes in an ukulele and a guitar flavour. The main difference is
that the guitar flavour uses guitar-chord-diagrams for standard tuning (EADGBE)
whereas the ukulele flavour uses chord diagrams specific to the ukulele standard
tuning (GCEA).
It is also possible to specify songs or versions of them to appear only in one
of the editions. See the documentation for details.
